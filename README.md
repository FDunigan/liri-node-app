# liri-node-app

The Liri Node application allows a user to pull their latest tweets, search the OMDB for information about their favorite movies, and find specific information about songs through Spotify. 

This the first fully-functional back-end application I built, combining different media elements for a one-stop information shop. Instead of needing to go different apps and databases for information, a user can simply use the command line to find everything they need. 

## Usage

Users can get started by opening the liri.js file in their preferred code editor. Once there, they can open their terminal and run the corresponding commands from the Liri program. 

## Get Tweets
`node liri.js my-tweets`

## Search Song 
`node liri.js spotify-this-song <"song name">`

## Search Movie
`node liri.js movie-this <"movie name">`

## Technologies Used 
- Node.js
